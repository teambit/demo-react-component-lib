### A Bit workspace demostrating best practices to structuring design systems with Bit.


The design system is structured out of three scopes:

* [Elements](https://bit.dev/learn-harmony/elements): Elementary components, hooks and utils. Unopinionated building blocks for the composition of design systems.

* [Styles](https://bit.dev/learn-harmony/styles): A collection of components that form one or more themes. That includes, fonts, color palettes, sizes, and more.

* [Design System](https://bit.dev/learn-harmony/design-system): A collection of concrete and opinionated components unified by a single, cohenerent, design language.
