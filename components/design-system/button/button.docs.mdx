### Overview

Button component with click effect and built-in loader.  
Supports all props from base-ui and native html button native html button.

### Loading

The base-ui button has built in support for loading!  
Simply return a Promise from `onClick`, and button will automatically show a loader until it resolves.

```js live=true
<Button
  onClick={() => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1500))}
  importance="ghost"
>
  Click here to see loader
</Button>
```

You can also turn on the loading animation explicitly, using the `loading={isBusy}` prop.

> Use a promise when possible! it is easier and more maintainable.

```js live=true
<Button loading />
```

#### Multi trigger

By default, the button is disabled while loading (to prevent duplicate triggers). This can be changed by using the `activeWhenLoading` prop.

```js live=true
<>
  <Button
    onClick={() => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000))}
    activeWhenLoading
    importance="ghost"
  >
    click me repeatedly
  </Button>{' '}
  <Button
    onClick={() => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 1000))}
    importance="ghost"
  >
    (cannot) click me repeatedly
  </Button>
</>
```

### importance

The Evangelist button comes in three levels of "importance".  
For ever lesser importance, use the inline link-like `text-button`. (to be implemented)

##### Call to action

CTAs are "navigation lights" that lead the user in the only correct flow.  
Setting a button as 'cta' indicates the user _should_ press this button as the immediate next step.

> Do not add more than one cta button in a viewport, as this would confuse the user.

```js live
<Theme style={{ minHeight: 90 }}>
  <Button importance="cta" style={{ width: 120 }}>
    Submit
  </Button>
</Theme>
```

##### Main button - for most actions.

Indicates an action the user could take (like changing privacy, etc)

```js live
<Theme style={{ minHeight: 90 }}>
  <Button importance="ghost" style={{ width: 120 }}>
    Update
  </Button>
</Theme>
```

##### Light button

Indicates an action is undesirable or unimportant.
May also be used in areas with high contrast.

```js live
<Theme style={{ minHeight: 90 }}>
  <Button style={{ width: 120 }}>Learn more</Button>
</Theme>
```
